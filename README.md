# 5-Day-Data-Challenge

It's a 5-Day Data Cleaning Challenge on Kaggle. Each day, we're given one common data cleaning task, and we learn about the concept and intuition behind it, and practice applying it. 

FIRST DAY : Missing Data
We learn how to figure out whether we've got missing data and how to deal with it if we do.

SECOND DAY : Scaling and Normalisation
We learn about the difference between data normalization and data scaling, when to do each of them, and practice normalizing and scaling data.

THIRD DAY : Parsing Dates
We learn how to parse dates so that Python correctly recognizes them as dates and times.

FOURTH DAY : Character Encodings
We learn what character encodings are and how to get your text data to look the way itâ€™s supposed to.

FIFTH DAY : Inconsistent Data Entry
We learn how to use fuzzy matching to correct inconsistent data entry.
